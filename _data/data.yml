career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an experienced Program Manager and certified SAFe RTE. With over 17 years of experience in IT and digital transformation, I am known for my ability to manage large teams and budgets — up to 20 FTEs and $7M — being comfortable in both traditional and agile environments.
      
      My Gallup strengths — restorative, individualization, relator, arranger, and deliberative — have been instrumental in my professional success, and are mirrored in my personal life: as an avid sport enthusiast, I have found that these strengths translate well into my ability to set and achieve ambitious goals. 
      
      This discipline and focus extend into my professional endeavors, particularly in complex, international settings.
